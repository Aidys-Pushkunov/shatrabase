-- graphics --

* piece graphics
  * shadow and outline versions
* OK tower squares
* capture / defunkt animations


-- gui --

* position setup not fully working

* russian font too faint
* OK play game from set position
	* rationalize: change game text instead of insert variation
* playgame: disable Engine move when game over
* playgame: disable Engine move when jumping in gametext
* investigate touch displays

* OK save board flipped status
* OK fix window max'd save/restore (common Qt prob) 
  * save maximized state but keep default pos/size
* OK fix board sometimes off (animation/autoplay)


-- IO --

* save game should be more easy (e.g. slotFileSave does not save Clipboard !?)
* OK add timed move to Engine (alternatives to 'go inifinite')

-- strange things --

* app crash on play-game after urgent capture (not sure if related)
