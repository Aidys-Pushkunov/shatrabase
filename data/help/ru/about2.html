<h3>About SGN Databases</h3>

<p>SGN is a portable format between different Shatra programs, a file format 
that can be written and read sequentially, but not modified at random places.</p>
<p>Shatrabase is a viewer for these files, thus Shatrabase is somewhat limited in handling Shatra data
as these files can <i>not really</i> be handled like a proper database.</p>
<p>To work around some of these issues, Shatrabase handles smaller and larger files differently.
You can configure the limit where Shatrabase switches the algorithm according to your computers performance.</p>
<p>Smaller databases are read completely into memory and can be read and written.</p>
<p>Larger files are only indexed and as of version 0.9.4, the index is also saved to disk for a faster reopening
of a SGN file. As the games are not in memory, this algorithm does not allow saving the files again, so the
database is opened read-only</p>
<p>The index files are saved in the index-subdirectory of the Default Data Path. If the index directory or one
of its files is deleted, Shatrabase will recreate the Index file the next time you open the SGN file.</p>
<p>Shatrabase will open the index file instead of the SGN file if the filename fits (e.g. "Shatra.cxi" fits to any "Shatra.SGN")
if the date of the last modification fits to the date stored in the index file. So Shatrabase won't care for the path
where your SGN is located (you can relocate the file after indexing), but this limits the Index to only one file
with the same basename.</p>
