 <h3>History of Altai Shatra</h3>
 <p>The game of Shatra was known in ancient times. It is said that Altai warrior princes would settle their differences over
 a Shatra board, to avoid unnecessary spilling of blood. The game was said to have resembled checkers, but no rules have 
 survived until modern times.</p>
 <p>In 1979 a committee was formed, with the purpose of drawing up rules for a modern version of the game. This version, 
 which we have called 'Original', has only shatras and a biy (= king), although a shatra can promote to batyr (= queen, lit. "giant") 
 on reaching the final rank. You will see that each side has two rows of shatras on the main playing area (the 6 x 7 dimension makes 
 it impossible to locate the pieces on alternate squares - or corners - as they are placed in checkers), making 24 pieces in all for each side.</p>
 <p>Then, in 1985 one of the committee, Vilenin Taushkanov had the idea to extend the game by introducing chess pieces. In addition to 
 biy and batyr, he added the tura (= rook, lit. "chariot") and the yalkyn (= bishop, lit. ""), and removed the second row of shatras for each side (so 17 pieces per side). 
 We have called this version 'Extended'.</p>
 <p>This second version became the standard during the era of the USSR, and although the game was often played using counters (with markings for the piece-types) 
 presentation sets with chess pieces were common. It was a description of this version that was smuggled out of Altai, and found its way into 
 the late D. B. Pritchard's 1994 "Encyclopedia of Chess Variants". Meanwhile, in Moscow Lev Kurin had written in 1988 a description in the journal 
 «Molodaja gvardija», an online digest of which can be found at http://www.math.bas.bg/~iad/tyalie/shatra/shatrax.html (although, despite the 
 usefulness of its descriptions some rules turned out to be incorrect, others had not yet been formulated).</p>
 <p>After the fall of the USSR however, some felt that the Original version was more authentic, in that the ancient game was not known to 
 have contained chess pieces. This version is now the one officially played in Altai (and surrounding regions including Mongolia), 
 by a great number of people, as well as at competitions and festivals etc. 'Players' can also consist of teams.</p>
 
 <h3>Game Rules: Common</h3>
 <p>General rules:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The object is to capture your opponent's king, or stalemate them (so they have no moves).
  <br />A game may be drawn by agreement, or by repetition of a position (as in chess).
  <br /><br />
  <li>Pieces starting in the two fortresses are said to be 'in reserve'.
  <br />Reserve pieces are dropped, one by one onto the player's half of the central playing area.
  <br />Each such drop represents a single move of the game.
  <br /><br />
  <li>The two biys are located on the two gate squares 10 and 53 (or d4 and d11).
  <br />As reserve pieces, they are also dropped, after which they can move by one square in any direction. 
  <br />They can move back to their gate and be dropped again (while their temdek is on).
  <br /><br />
  <li>The (immovable) temdeks are represented by the crosses on the gate squares.
  <br />They are on, and remain on while any reserve piece is still on its original square.
  <br />Until its side's temdek is off, no piece can return to its fortress - only the biy to its gate.
  <br /><br />
  <li>Pieces other than shatras may be dropped from the opponent's fortress - shatras must promote first.
  <br />(such drops are of course onto the opponent's half of the playing area.)
 </ul>
 <p>Rules of capture:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>All pieces capture by jumping over an opponent's piece within range.
  <br />All captures are compulsory - if a piece can be captured, it must be (see biy rules for exceptions).
  <br />Any capture that can be continued, must be - and so on, as long as pieces remain to be captured.
  <br />Given a choice of initial captures (or a choice during a sequence), the player decides.
  <br /><br />
  <li>Shatras and biys can capture an adjacent piece only, in any direction.
  <br /><br />
  <li>Sliding pieces (the batyr being common to both versions) can capture along their respective vectors.
  <br />After capturing, sliders can continue along the same vector for as many squares as are unoccupied,
  <br />
  but they *must* take the first of any available capture continuations.
  <br /><br />
  <li>The biy alone has the right to 'pass', or end a capture sequence at any point.
  <br />The biy also has the right not to capture at all (if no other piece can also capture), but then must move instead.
  <br />These 'evasions' include drop moves, if the biy is on its original square (with the temdek on).
  <br /><br />
  <li>Shatras reaching a promotion square by capture only promote if they end their capture or sequence there,
  <br />otherwise they must once again reach a promotion square.
  <br /><br />
  <li>Captured pieces are left in position during a sequence, so no piece may be jumped over twice.
 </ul>
 <h3>Game Rules: Original version</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Shatras in reserve must be dropped onto the playing area in sequence, starting with the square next to the biy (9 or 54).
  <br /><br />
  <li>Shatras move one square forwards, diagonally, or sideways (ie a shatra in the centre can move to one of five squares).
  <br /><br />
  <li>A shatra promotes to batyr on reaching the final rank (1 or 14)).
 </ul>
 <h3>Game Rules: Extended version</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>The board is conceptually divided in two, the division being called pob (= ditch, or moat).
  <br /><br />
  <li>Pieces in reserve are dropped onto the playing area in any order (up to the pob, of course).
  <br /><br />
  <li>Yalkyns move like chess bishops, any number of squares diagonally.
  <br />Turas move like chess rooks, any number of squares orthogonally.  
  <br /><br />
  <li>Before the pob, shatras move like chess pawns, one or two squares forwards.
  <br />For the latter, en passant captures exist (as in chess), but in accordance with general capture rules.
  <br />When an en passant would otherwise be possible, the capture of the shatra itself is allowed if the en passant capture is blocked.
  <br /><br />
  <li>On reaching the pob, shatras can move one square forwards or diagonally.
  <br />Past the pob, they can move sideways as well (this equates to shatra movement in the Original version).
  <br /><br />
  <li>A shatra promotes on reaching the final rank (1 or 14), but only if there is a captured piece of the same side to promote to.
  <br />If no piece type other than shatra has been captured, the shatra must wait (or move sideways, or capture).
  <br />Such delayed promotions are automatic, taking place on the opponent's (capturing) turn.
  <br /><br />
  <li>The four corner squares of the main playing area are called tower squares.
  <br />A shatra that reaches one of its opponent's tower squares can 'teleport' onto any vacant square in that fortress.
  <br />If that square is a promotion square, the shatra promotes immediately (subject to the previous rule).
